# Time Series Modelling with Auto ARIMA

This project involves Time Series Modelling using Auto ARIMA with data sourced from the ICICI Bank website. The objective is to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict and model the time series data related to ICICI Bank's financial information.

## Overview

The project aims to utilize time series forecasting techniques to predict financial metrics based on data extracted from the ICICI Bank website. It involves exploring, preprocessing, and modeling the time series data to derive meaningful insights and accurate predictions.

## Techniques Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data manipulation and modeling.
- **Machine Learning**: Leveraging Auto ARIMA for time series forecasting.
- **Deep Learning**: Implementing neural networks for enhanced predictions.
- **Data Scraping**: Extracting time series data from the ICICI Bank website.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for modeling.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: Scraping financial time series data from the ICICI Bank website.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling the data.
- **Modelling**: Applying Auto ARIMA and deep learning techniques for time series forecasting.
